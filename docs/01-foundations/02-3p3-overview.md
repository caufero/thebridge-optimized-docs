# **Chapter 2 — 3P3 Overview**

### *Three Perspectives on Three Realities*

## **2.1 Essence of 3P3**

3P3 means **Three Perspectives on Three Realities**.
It is an ontological architecture in which **everything is Entity**, and every entity reveals itself through **three inseparable manifestations**:

1. **ASPETTO** — what the entity *is* (structure / form)
2. **NATURA** — what the entity *does* (process / action)
3. **ENTITÀ** — what the entity *becomes* (integration / being)

These are not separable parts; they are three windows into a **single ontological unity**. All three aspects are **simultaneous** and together form *one entity*.

The ontology explicitly rejects distinctions such as:

* “model vs instance”
* “template vs record”
* “definition vs execution”

These are simply different *perspectives* of the same reality.

## **2.2 The Tripartition**

The tripartition is fundamental:
Every entity has:

### **ASPETTO (Aspect / Structure)**

* What the entity *is*
* Its form, template, structure, and possibility
* Symbol: 🔵
* Materialized in FileMaker as **CMP** table (Components/Templates/Instances)

### **NATURA (Nature / Process)**

* What the entity *does*
* Its action, flow, history
* Symbol: 🔴
* Materialized in FileMaker as **LOG** table (History/Process)

### **ENTITÀ (Entity / Being)**

* What the entity *becomes*
* Its integrated existence
* Symbol: 🟡
* Materialized in FileMaker as **ETY** table (State/Being)

## **2.3 One Entity = Three Perspectives**

The document emphasizes the **unity** of the entity:

```
ONE ENTITY
ASPETTO  ←→  NATURA  ←→  ENTITÀ
```

All three perspectives point to the same ontological being. They are not layers, not versions, not derivatives—
they are *the same entity* seen from three different interpretative lenses.

This unification is what makes 3P3 radically different from traditional systems, where structure, logic, and instance are artificially separated into tables, scripts, layouts, and code.

---

## **2.4 The 3P3 Formula**

The document gives a foundational expression:

```
1E = 3P3 = 1D × 1A × 1E
```

Where:

* **1E** = One Entity
* **3P3** = Three Perspectives on Three Realities
* **1D** = One Domain
* **1A** = One Algorithm
* **1E** (recursive) = One Entity again

---

## **2.5 Practical Interpretation for FileMaker**

The guide states that traditional FileMaker development requires dozens of tables, hundreds of scripts, and many layouts.

Under 3P3, the ontology collapses the system into:

* **3 tables** (CMP, ETY, LOG)
* **4 scripts** (the Universal Navigators)
* **1 layout** (the SuperTable)

This reduction is explicitly listed in the “Why This Matters” section of the guide.

This minimalism is possible because the entity carries its own definition (ASPETTO), its own process (NATURA), and its own instance (ENTITÀ). Nothing needs to be duplicated or rewritten for each “type” of thing.

---

## **2.6 MET ↔ OPE: The Sacred Correspondence**

A central law of 3P3:

> **Every MET (Meta-Attribute) has exactly one OPE (Operation).**

This is referred to as *non-negotiable* and called the foundation of the entire system.

* MET represents universal attributes (56 of them).
* OPE represents universal operations (56 of them).

The uploaded file lists samples of MET and OPE records, confirming the attributes, their Type, Domain, examples, and 1:1 linking between the two sets.

This correspondence is essential because NATURA manifests through operations exactly aligned with the ASPETTO definition.

---

## **2.7 Why 3P3 Is Revolutionary**

Based directly on the guide:

### **Unified Ontology**

Everything is Entity, eliminating dualities such as data vs metadata, templates vs instances, logic vs data.

### **Self-Similarity**

Entities define themselves, process themselves, and become themselves—supporting autopoiesis (self-generation) and Turing completeness as noted in the glossary.

### **Universalization**

With MET, OPE, and ATR, the system is capable of expressing any computation or business requirement using universal primitives.

### **Radical Simplification**

Three tables and four scripts replace the combinatorial explosion found in traditional FileMaker solutions.

---

## **2.8 Summary**

3P3 establishes:

* A unified ontology based on ASPETTO, NATURA, ENTITÀ
* A universal system of 56 meta-attributes and 56 operations
* A minimal FileMaker architecture (CMP, ETY, LOG)
* A self-referential and self-describing structure
* One entity expressed through three inseparable perspectives

This chapter provides the conceptual foundation on which the entire rest of the architecture (CMP, ETY, LOG, Universal Navigators, SuperTable, Bootstrap, and Instance Generator) will be built.
