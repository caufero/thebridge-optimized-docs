# Introduction to The Bridge

The Bridge is a structured methodology for designing business systems that behave as unified, coherent platforms rather than collections of isolated software features.

It provides a consistent way to define entities, processes, data relationships, and interactions across an organization. The Bridge focuses on ontology first, ensuring that every function, workflow, and interface is derived from a stable conceptual model rather than ad-hoc implementation decisions.

The Bridge supports models such as the 3P3 Framework, Domain Attributes, the Matrix, and the Process Manager. These models work together to create predictable behavior, traceability, and long-term scalability across complex systems.

The Bridge is not a product. It is a design language and architectural foundation that guides how systems are structured, executed, and evolved over time.
