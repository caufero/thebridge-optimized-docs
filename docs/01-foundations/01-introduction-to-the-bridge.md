# Introduction

The Bridge is a technical and conceptual framework for building business systems whose behavior is consistent, explainable, and adaptable over time. It treats a software system as a space of entities and relationships rather than a collection of isolated screens, scripts, and tables.

Instead of starting from user interface mockups or individual features, The Bridge starts from ontology:  
what exists in the domain, how it is structured, and how it changes. From that foundation, processes, interfaces, data models, and automation flows are derived in a controlled and repeatable way.

The Bridge underlies the 3P3 ontological system, the core tables used in the FileMaker implementation, and the Process Manager that executes complex behaviors. This document explains how all these pieces fit together and how to implement them in a real system.
