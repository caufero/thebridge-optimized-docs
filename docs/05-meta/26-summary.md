# Giftera Website Content Spec (Final Copy for Developers)
Version: v1.0  
Scope: Public marketing website only. Other platforms exist, but this document covers the website content that visitors see before login.

## Goal
Create a premium experience that feels trustworthy, polished, and valuable at first glance. The copy must be easy to understand after one read.

## Target Users
- People who read comfortably and want clarity fast.
- People who read slowly and rely on visuals, short sentences, and familiar terms like MoMo.
- People who want proof that the service is safe and real.

## Copy Rules
1. Use short sentences.
2. Avoid vague wording.
3. Use familiar words. Use "MoMo" where it helps.
4. Every section must answer one clear question.
5. Trust must be visible in multiple places: payment, delivery, support, and privacy.
