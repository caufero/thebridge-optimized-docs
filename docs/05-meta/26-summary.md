# **PHASE 1 – HOURS REPORT (NOVEMBER 2025)**

Prepared for: **KOOLTOOL SRL (Luca Meggiolaro)**

Prepared by: **Caufero (Cyril Amegah & Osbert Vulor)**

## **1. Overview**

This document provides the monthly hour breakdown for **November 2025**, corresponding to **Invoice 4** under Phase 1 of THE BRIDGE collaboration.

November work focused on:

1. **Deep study and interpretation** of the extended 3P3 documentation set provided by Luca, including ontological foundations, Template rules, Navigator specifications, and conceptual matrices.
2. **Substantial updates to the full Technical Specification document**, producing a new, expanded version that consolidated all findings from August–October and aligned them with the ontology clarified in November.

## **3. Breakdown of November Work**

---

### **3.1 Review & Assimilation of Extended 3P3 Documentation**

**Total: 69 hours**

Activities included:

* Studying the *Complete Implementation Guide*
* Reviewing *3P3 Ontological Propaedeutic*
* Analysing *TAB27 – Generative Triad (Father–Mother–Son)*
* Integrating insights from the *3P3 ESSENCE* document
* Mapping ENTITY → TUPLE → RECORD onto the ontological structure
* Understanding the deeper logic behind the Template, Navigation, and Domain systems
* Preparing conceptual clarifications to ensure the Technical Specification matched Luca’s 30-year ontological architecture

---

### **3.2 Updating & Expanding the Technical Specification Document (Newest Version)**

**Total: 61 hours**

This was the **largest workload** for November.

Work included:

* Rewriting major sections based on new ontological clarifications
* Restructuring the full document into the 17-chapter architecture
* Formalizing rules for CMP/ETY/LOG symmetry
* Rewriting all architecture diagrams into text form
* Consolidating insights from August–October into a unified specification
* Adding missing definitions, tables, explanations, and technical formulations
* Reviewing TAB37 & TAB38 and aligning terminology

---

### **3.3 Navigation Framework & Interaction Logic**

**Total: 28 hours**

Tasks included:

* Reviewing the Navigation Map (Session 2)
* Studying Navigator Specs (Session 3)
* Analysing transitions across the Z-axis
* Reviewing the JSX Navigator prototype
* Integrating navigation implications into the updated Technical Specification

---

### **3.4 Template System & MET/OPE Alignment**

**Total: 14 hours**

Activities included:

* Analysing Template propagation rules
* Clarifying MET and OPE structural symmetry
* Mapping Template → ETY → LOG interactions
* Updating these sections in the technical document

---

### **3.5 Internal Alignment & Phase 2 Preparation**

**Total: 10 hours**

This included:

* Reviewing interpretations between Cyril and Osbert
* Creating internal technical notes for Phase 2
* Identifying implementation points that depend on ontology confirmation

---

## **4. Confirmation**

The hours listed above accurately represent the work carried out in **November 2025**, covering both:

* research and interpretation of newly received 3P3 materials, and
* extensive rewriting and expansion of the Technical Specification into the version delivered to Luca.
