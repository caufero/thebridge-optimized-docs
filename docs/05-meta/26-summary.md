# Suggested Improvements To 4KPAINT Solution
   
Here are some improvements to the 4KPAINT solution, that we will love to suggest.

---

## 1) Dashboard
- Add a small **Approvals section** on the Dashboard:
    - Daily Logs pending approval
    - Time Cards pending approval
    - Pay Rates pending approval
    - Each one should be clickable and open the filtered list.

 
- Add **quick buttons** on the Dashboard:
    - New Daily Log
    - Approve Time Cards
    - Approve Pay Rates
    - Open Master Ledger
    - Open Cost Reports

- Add quick time filters on the Dashboard:
    - Today
    - This Week
    - This Month

---

## 2) Ledger + Reporting
- Put **Master Ledger + Cost Reports** on one screen (tabs/toggle), so switching between them is effortless for the user (though the actual layouts involved could be more than one).
- Add drilldown (where it could be added):
    - From totals → jump to supporting lines/logs/time entries.

---

## 3) Daily Logs
- Add clear workflow states to the list:
  - Draft → Submitted → Approved → Locked
- Make locking strict:
  - Locked means no edits for normal users.
  - Unlock should require a reason + log who did it and when.
- Improve materials entry:
  - Make it structured (qty + item) or select-from-list.
- Improve notes:
  - Add categories like Safety / Issues / Progress / Delays / Client Request.
- Add photo attachments to logs:
  - Jobsite photos directly on the daily log.

---

## 4) Time Cards
- Bulk approve/unapprove should be safer:
  - Show preview before approving.
  - Unapprove should require a reason + log it.
- Add overtime rules (if they want it):
  - Daily or weekly thresholds.
- Add time rounding rules (if they want it):
  - Nearest 15 mins etc.

---

## 5) Pay Rates
- Pay rate effective dating:
  - Apply correct rate based on date worked.
- Rate edit audit trail:
  - Who changed it, old/new values, date/time, reason.
- Bulk approve preview (same idea as time cards).

---

## 6) Setups (Clients / Jobs / Employees / Contractors / Suppliers)
- Add required-field checks before records can be used:
  - Jobs must have client + supervisor + active status before appearing in logs.
- Prevent duplicates for key lists:
  - Clients, suppliers, employees.
- Keep the setup screens consistent:
  - Same tab structure and list tools across all setup modules.

---

## 7) iOS modules
- Photo capture straight into Daily Logs.

---

## 8) UI updates
- Uniform window sizes on desktop.
- Standard toolbar placement (Filter/Export/Print/Email) across modules.
- Suggested UI enhancements that will still keep the same ideas of the current UI arrangements

---

## Summary of suggested updates
1) Dashboard approvals section + quick links  
2) Master Ledger + Cost Reports together  
3) Export includes filter context  
4) Daily Log states + strict lock/unlock logging  
5) Bulk approval preview + reversal reason logging  
6) Pay rate effective dating + audit trail  
7) Photos on daily logs (iOS)
8) More structured materials capturing for daily logs
