* **How Users Pay for Premium Templates**

  ```
  -   When a user selects a premium template in the web portal or mobile app, the system displays:
      -   Template price (e.g., GHS 10, GHS 15, GHS 20)
      -   A “Purchase Template” button

  -   Payment Flow
      1.  User selects a premium template
      2.  A payment prompt appears
      3.  User confirms payment
      4.  MoMo payment request is sent (STK Push)
      5.  After successful payment, the template unlocks instantly
      6.  User may proceed to send the gift with that template

  -   Once a template is purchased:
      -   It appears in My Templates → Purchased
      -   The user can use it anytime without paying again
  ```

  * **Technical Expectations for Admin Portal**

    ```
    -   It should consume secure backend APIs that enforce:
        -   Role based access control
        -   Authentication and authorisation

    -   UX expectations:
        -   Pagination and filtering on all large lists
        -   Strong input validation on all forms
    ```
