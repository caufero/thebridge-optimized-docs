## 1. Purpose of this document

This report confirms the objectives and activities completed during **October 2025**, which are covered by **Invoice 3** for Phase 1 of **THE BRIDGE – 3P3 Implementation Research**.

The work delivered in October aligns with the Phase 1 description provided in the contract:

* Continued research activities
* Documentation work
* Technical specifications review

---

## 2. Reference documents and emails for October

October work is based on the following material sent by Luca:

1. **8 October 2025 – Luca shared updated Algorithm and Process Manager** 

   * **THE BRIDGE 3P3 ALGORITHM UK.pdf** – Complete algorithm and operational cycle of the 3P3 system 
   * **THE BRIDGE – Process Manager 3P3_v02.html** – Updated Process Manager GUI description (NAME, CHAR, FLOW panels)

2. **23 October 2025 – Luca sent foundational documents to be studied before defining technical specs** 

   * **3P3 ESSENCE.pdf** – Technical foundation bridging ontology and FileMaker implementation 
   * **doc_ontological_propaedeutic_3p3_UK.md** – Ontological guide for implementation 
   * **3P3_CELL_ONTOLOGY.png** – Visual representation of the 3P3 cell
   * **CDL_ETY_56x56_v04.xlsx** – Operational matrix of meta attributes and operations 
   * **MET_LIST_56_v01.xlsx** – Meta attribute list and properties 

These materials define the scope of the research and review work carried out in October.

## 3. Continued research activities (October 2025)

During October, Caufero focused on deepening the understanding of 3P3 ontology and its implications for THE BRIDGE implementation.

Key research activities included:

1. **Study of THE BRIDGE 3P3 ALGORITHM UK**

   * Analysed the complete 3P3 operating cycle from Definition to Intelligence Update. 
   * Examined the continuous loop of user action, system processing, result, and SUPERTABLE update, and mapped it to the CMP–ETY–LOG architecture. 
   * Reviewed the triple identification system (DNA, STRUCTURE, LOCATION) and considered how these identifiers can be represented in FileMaker structures. 

2. **Exploration of 3P3 ESSENCE**

   * Reviewed how the 3P3 cube adds ontological depth beyond classic row–column databases. 
   * Studied the role of attributes, tuples, and ontological depth and how these map to CMP, ETY, LOG and the planned JSON driven templates. 

3. **Ontological foundations and matrix based control**

   * Read the **Ontological Propaedeutic** to understand how CMP, ETY, LOG correspond to ASPECT, NATURE, and ENTITY at database level. 
   * Examined the description of CDL_ETY as the binding executive specification that drives operations and meta attributes, and how it must guide all implementation choices. 

4. **Foundational document reading plan**

   * Followed Luca’s recommended reading order for ESSENCE, Propaedeutic, Cell Ontology, CDL_ETY, and MET_LIST to consolidate an integrated mental model of the system. 

This research work in October prepared the ground for precise and faithful implementation in later phases.

## 4. Documentation work (October 2025)

In parallel with research, we updated and refined internal documentation so that the implementation guidelines remain aligned with the evolving 3P3 materials.

Documentation work included:

1. **Internal notes on 3P3 Algorithm and Process Manager**

   * Documented how the steps in the 3P3 algorithm (entity creation, attribute definition, flow definition, intelligence update) translate into FileMaker scripts, JSON structures, and WebViewer interfaces. 
   * Clarified how the updated Process Manager 3P3_v02 GUI (NAME, CHAR, FLOW panels) can be generated from template JSON and CMP definitions.

2. **Bridge between ESSENCE and existing technical specification**

   * Updated internal design notes to reflect the explanations in 3P3 ESSENCE about the three dimensional cube and meta attribute domains, linking them to the CMP–ETY–LOG model already documented in the Full Technical Specification.

3. **Matrix driven implementation guidance**

   * Captured practical rules for using CDL_ETY and MET_LIST during implementation, for example the need to consult the matrix whenever an operation is implemented and to follow the defined WRITE, READ, or CALCULATE actions for each OPE and MET combination. 

4. **Preparation for later technical alignment**

   * Organised questions, observations, and alignment points to discuss with Luca regarding the relationship between the algorithm document, ESSENCE, and our existing JSON based approach.

These documentation activities ensured that the knowledge from the October documents was not only read but also structured into actionable implementation guidance.

## 5. Technical specifications review (October 2025)

October also included a focused review of technical specifications already in place, viewed through the lens of the new October materials.

Activities included:

1. **Review of existing Phase 1 technical specification against 3P3 Algorithm**

   * Cross checked the previously delivered Full Technical Specification with the sequence and concepts described in THE BRIDGE 3P3 ALGORITHM UK, identifying areas where terminology or sequencing needed to be adjusted for full coherence.

2. **Analysis of the Process Manager role in the overall architecture**

   * Reviewed how Process Manager should sit as the configuration tool used by the organizer level and how it connects CMP, ETY, LOG and JSON, as described in the October materials.

3. **Validation of ontological consistency**

   * Checked that the way attributes, operations, and templates were described in earlier documentation is compatible with the ontology described in ESSENCE, the Propaedeutic, CDL_ETY, and MET_LIST.

4. **Preparation for later implementation guide integration**

   * Prepared a list of points that would later need to be reflected in the complete implementation guide and navigator specifications that arrived in November, so that Phase 2 can start from a consistent base.

## 6. Alignment with Phase 1 scope

The work carried out in **October 2025** was basically:

* **Continued research activities**

  * Intensive study of 3P3 Algorithm, ESSENCE, Propaedeutic, CDL_ETY, MET_LIST, and Cell Ontology.

* **Documentation work**

  * Consolidation of notes, internal design updates, and implementation guidance derived from the October documents.

* **Technical specifications review**

  * Cross checking existing technical specifications against the new October materials to ensure consistency with the 3P3 methodology.

## 7. Conclusion

The activities described above represent the work completed in **October 2025** and provide the basis for **Invoice 3** for Phase 1 of THE BRIDGE project.
