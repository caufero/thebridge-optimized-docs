- For USSD
    #### 1. Core Purpose of the USSD
    -   USSD should be simple, lightweight, and solve three things:
        -   Allow non-smartphone users to send gifts via USSD
        -   Allow non-smartphone users to read their full message
        -   Let receivers confirm / check gift delivery

    -   Sender Flow
        ```
        1.  The sender dials: *123*7# (or whatever UUSD code assigned to this platform)
        
        2.  The USSD system displays:

                -   STEP 1: Welcome Screen
                                Gift Link

                                3.  Help

                    STEP 2: Choose a template style:
                            -   Gold (Premium)
                            -   Silver (Calm)
                            -   Blue (Romantic)
                            -   Yellow (Cheerful)
                            -   Basic SMS Only

                    STEP 3: Enter Recipient Number: _____
                            User enters receiver's phone number: 0243XXXXXXX

                    STEP 4: Enter Amount: _____
                            User enters the amount being gifted

                    STEP 5: Enter Your Message: _____
                            Examples:

                            -   Thinking of you.
                            -   Thank you for everything.
                            -   Sorry for earlier today.

                    STEP 6: Confirm Gift
                                Confirm Gift:
                                To:         0243XXXXXXX
                                Amount:     GHS 20
                                Template:   Gold
                                Message:    "Happy birthday!"

                                1. Send Gift    2. Edit     3. Cancel

                    STEP 7: MoMo Prompt
                                Sender receives:
                                “Approve payment of GHS 20 to GiftLink.”

                                When approved, backend:
                                -   Saves the full gift
                                -   Creates a gift_code (5–7 digits)
                                -   Chooses a template based on the selected category
                                -   Sends message to receiver
                                -   Triggers MoMo disbursement

                    STEP 8: Success Screen
                                Gift sent successfully!
                                Recipient will receive money + your message shortly.
                                Thank you for using GiftLink.

                                Sender ALSO receives an SMS receipt:
                                “Your GiftLink gift to 0541234567 has been delivered.”
        ```

    -   Receiver Flow
        ```
        1.  The receiver receives:

                a.   MoMo alert
                b.   Message from GiftLink with a gift code (Can be received via SMS, WhatsApp, Email or In-app notification <app / web>)
                    -   Example:

                        "You’ve received a special gift 🎁 from Ama!
                        Tap to view your customised message + gift details:
                        https://giftlink.com/view/ABCD1234

                        Or dial *123*5*987# to view the message"

        2.  Now the receiver dials: *123*7# (or whatever code you get from aggregator)
        
        3.  The USSD system displays:

                USSD Menu Flow (Receiver)

                -   STEP 1: Welcome Screen
                                Gift Link
                                1.  Send a Gift
                                2.  View Gift
                                3.  Help

                            User chooses 2.

                            User enters: 48291

                -   STEP 3: Display the Message
                                System pulls the stored message text and shows:

                                Example

                                From:       Kwame
                                Message:    “I appreciate you so much. Enjoy this surprise gift.”

                                1.  Mark as Read
                                2.  Exit

                            If message is too long, break into USSD pages:
                                -   Page 1: first 140 chars
                                -   “Next”
                                -   Page 2: remainder
                                -   “Back / Mark as Read / Exit”

                    STEP 4: Confirmation
                            If user chooses “Mark as Read”:
                                Gift successfully delivered. Thank you for using GiftLink.

                            This updates the sender’s dashboard to “Read”.
